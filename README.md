# regression_analysis

I've been learning the theory around statistical analysis and regression analysis, which I wanted to put into (python) practice. I've chosen the 2021 World Happiness dataset available on the Kaggle website. The following sections take you step by step through the approach I've adopted and the code I used to explore the dataset and visualise the insights. 
The analysis concerns particularly around which variables are the most important when measuring the happiness score of a particular country and builds a regression model to predict this score.

This is a visulaised world happiness index for 2021, taken from: "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/p911cr/oc_2021_world_happiness_index/"

To run the code, use world_happiness_regression_analysis script and the available dataset, you'll also need to import the ecdf_function.py file with some pre-written functions.
